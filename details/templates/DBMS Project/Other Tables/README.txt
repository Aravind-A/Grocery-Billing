 Disclaimer: I'm an idiot who has only written `display: flex` twice in her life, including this demo. I have no fuckin' clue about flexbox and how it works. I just tried out ideas to see if they work. 

So this is sorting a table with JS and flexbox. No messing with the DOM, I'm just changing the `order` property of the flex item via JS after I've sorted the table entries. Tested & works in Firefox 34; Chrome 39/ Opera 27. Buggy styling in IE11, though sorting itself works. 

Stole the name and the idea to do a daily JS demo from here http://blog.michaelarestad.com/333/js-fitness/ ❤ 

Basically, what I want to do is to try to do a JS demo every day starting January 5. Let's see how this works out. This is day #6, January 10.

Comments and suggestions on how to improve this much appreciated. ❤
